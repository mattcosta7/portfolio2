      Rails-based app designed to teach children to code in an interactive, fun undersea themed environment. Users follow lessons, input code into an embedded text editor, that has realtime syntax highlighting and linting. Realtime chatrooms are available in every lesson for students and mentors to assist each other with problems. Users can view others near them, to easily facilitate camaraderie and local assistance.
